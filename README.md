# React app using Material-UI

This is a app to practice/testing material-ui and refactoring my stock app based on new techniques I discovered when refining my react best practices.

It uses React and React-Dom version 0.14, material-ui, webpack 1.x and babel 6.

You should have node/npm installed as well.

To start it assumes you have the following installed globally
```
npm install babel webpack webpack-dev-server -g
```

Then do the following:

```
npm install
```

Lastly do the following:

```
npm start
```

You should have a dev server running on port 3333.  

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3333

TODO

1. ~~Refactor to make a new StockTableRow component~~
2. ~~PropTypes~~
3. Test :)
4. Hide AutoComplete bar when adding a stock and have it show again after adding a stock or cancelling.
5. Refactor with Optimizations
6. Refactor with code style
7. Refactor when table on row selection bug is resolved.
